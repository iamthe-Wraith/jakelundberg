		<h2>Hardware</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Jake recently updated his desk to a <a href="https://amzn.to/47abisC" target="_blank">HUANUO 48″ x 24″ Electric Standing Desk</a>
				and has been really happy with it. It's not as fancy as some of the other desks out there, but it's sturdy, has a good range of motion, and the price was right.
			</li>
			<li>
				His desk chair is a <a href="https://secretlabchairs.ca/products/titan-evo-2022-series?sku=R22PU-Batman" target="_blank">Secretlab Titan Evo</a> emblazened
				with the Batman logo with <a href="https://amzn.to/3Td6ZXE" target="_blank">clear roller blade wheels</a> that are super smooth, even on carpet.
			</li>
			<li>
				He is currently using a 2021 16" Macbook Pro M1 Max with 64 GB ram and a 2TB SSH. And of course, it's covered in stickers!
			</li>
			<li>
				Jake's main monitor is a <a href="https://www.sceptre.com/Monitors/2K-4K-Series/C355W-3440UN-35-Curved-Monitor-product1176category12category98.html" target="_blank">Scepter C355W-3440UN 35" Curved Monitor</a>.
				And above it are two <a href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/monitors/essential/s1/pdp/UM.HS1EE.C01" target="_blank">27" Acer S271HL Widescreen LCD Monitors</a> on separate <a href="https://amzn.to/3Xcm2Ca" target="_blank">VIVO Triple LCD LED Computer Monitor Desk Stands</a>
				with the lower arms removed.
			</li>
			<li>
				He told me one of the best investments he ever made was splurging on a <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander" target="_blank">Moonlander Mark I keyboard</a>. It's a bit
				pricey, but has easily been the most comfortable and customizable keyboard he's ever used.
			</li>
			<li>
				His mouse is a <a href="https://amzn.to/3yYjwrj" target="_blank">ZLOT Vertical Gaming Mouse</a>.
				It's lasted for years and he really likes the ergonomics of it.
			</li>
			<li>
				He has been using the same <a href="https://amzn.to/3Msi3MT" target="_blank">Blue Yeti microphone</a> for probably 10 years now and
				it's still going strong. He doesn't do a lot of recording or anything, but when he does it's always been great.
			</li>
			<li>
				His webcam is a generic <a href="https://amzn.to/3XCfdvr" target="_blank">1080P Webcam with Microphone</a>
				that was a gift several years ago and it's been working great. He will probably upgrade to something better soon, but for now it's been perfect.
			</li>
			<li>
				With all these monitors and devices, he needed something to keep them all connected without having to deal with a bunch of cables...not to mention there are only
				so many ports on a Macbook. So he picked up a
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4cRDcen" target="_blank">StarTech.com Thunderbolt 3 to Dual DisplayPort Adapter</a>,
				a <a href="https://amzn.to/3XauWjH" target="_blank">Selore&S-Global USB C to Dual HDMI Adapter</a>, and a
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4g1zBgF" target="_blank">13 port LATORICE Powered USB Hub</a>
				to plug them all into. Then those are all connected via an
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4cQfrTK" target="_blank">OWC 5 Port Thunderbolt Hub</a>.
				Now when he gets to his desk, all he has to do is plug in 1 USB C cable and everything is good to go!
			</li>
			<li>
				Jake always hated having to carry around all kinds of bricks and adapters to plug in and charge stuff. He searched for a while
				and nothing really worked great, but finally he found this
				<a href="https://amzn.to/3Zaw8WS" target="_blank">Portable 7 Port Fast Charging Station</a>.
				Now he can charge his laptop, phone, iPad, and anything else he needs all at the same time.
			</li>
			<li>
				He also tried a bunch of different USB C cables, but his favorite one by far has to be the 
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4cK6P1b" target="_blank">Dbilida 6.6ft Thunderbolt 3 Cable (40Gbps)</a>. He's
				had it for a long time and it's still going strong.
			</li>
			<li>
				He carries everything in a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Xc3JwY" target="_blank">REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical Backpack Large Army 3 Day
				Assault Pack Molle Bag Backpack</a> The Molle system is fantastic when you have lots of gadgets and things you need to keep organized.
			</li>
			<li>
				He listens to <a href="https://amzn.to/3yYjMXj" target="_blank">Beats Fit Pro</a> earbuds most of the time, whether he's at his desk or
				out and about.
			</li>
			<li>
				But when he doesn't have his headerphones in, he has a <a href="https://amzn.to/3AGTlWs" target="_blank">Creative Pebble Plus 2.1
				USB-Powered Desktop Speakers with Powerful Down-Firing Subwoofer</a> plugged in to his laptop for when he wants to jam out.
			</li>
			<li>
				Another small but awesome little piece of gear is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Tel2wb" target="_blank">Luxtude electronic organizer case</a>.
				This thing is fantastic for storing and organizing all his cables and accessories.
			</li>
			<li>
				After a long search for the right power bank to carry with him, he finally found the
				<a href="https://amzn.to/3AIFCym" target="_blank">Omni 20+ 20000mah Laptop Power Bank Portable Charger</a>. It's been the
				perfect companion for his laptop and phone when he's on the go.
			</li>

		<h2>Software</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Most of his development is done in <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">Visual Studio Code</a> with the
				<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme" target="_blank">GitHub Dark Default</a> theme.
				But he was a longtime Vim user, so he still opens that up from time to time to edit files and make quick changes. He has a custom theme called
				<a href="https://github.com/iamthe-Wraith/breeze" target="_blank">Breeze</a> he uses for Vim that's a fork of the
				<a href="https://github.com/dracula/vim" target="_blank">Dracula</a> theme.
			</li>
			<li>
				A couple years ago Jake switched to using the <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" target="_blank">Warp</a> terminal and has never looked back.
				It's a fantastic tool with so many little benefits he could (and does) go on about it for a while...but don't worry, I won't do that to you.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://arc.net/" target="_blank">Arc</a> is his primary browser of choice, which he uses for just about everything.
			</li>
			<li>
				He replaced Mac's built in Spotlight with <a href="https://www.raycast.com/" target="_blank">Raycast</a> (Pro version) for quick and easy access to
				multiple AI models and a bunch of plugins.
			</li>
			<li>
				For note taking he uses <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> with a few different vaults to help keep things organized. Particularly
				his "slip-box", which is where he keeps all his notes and ideas...a method he learned from one of his favorite books,
				<a href="https://amzn.to/3ZbBhOr" target="_blank">How to Take Smart Notes</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a> is his password manager of choice. It used to be LastPass, but he switched a few years ago
				after some security concerns.
			</li>
			<li>
				He's been a loyal <a href="https://proton.me/mail" target="_blank">Proton</a> customer for many years now. He uses it for all his personal email,
				encrypted cloud storage, and VPN.
			</li>
			<li>
				He built <a href="https://buzybee.buzz" target="_blank">BuzyBee</a> to help himself manage all his tasks and projects using the
				<a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/" target="_blank">GTD Methodology</a>, and uses it every day. It's not currently
				available to the public, but be sure to sign up for the waitlist if you're interested and we will let you know as soon as it
				becomes available!
			</li>
			<li>
				He recently switched to <a href="https://omnivore.app" target="_blank">Omnivore</a> to manage, organize and track all his reading. He was using
				<a href="https://readwise.io/" target="_blank">Readwise</a>, but wasn't really happy with it. Omnivore has been a great replacement.
			</li>

		That's about it for now. I'll be sure to remind him to update this page as he finds new tools and software that make his life easier and better.
