		<h2>Hardware</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				I recently updated my desk to a <a href="https://amzn.to/47abisC" target="_blank">HUANUO 48â€³ x 24â€³ Electric Standing Desk</a>
				and I've been really happy with it. It's not as fancy as some of the other desks out there, but it's sturdy, has a good range of motion, and the price was right.
			</li>
			<li>
				My desk chair is a <a href="https://secretlabchairs.ca/products/titan-evo-2022-series?sku=R22PU-Batman" target="_blank">Secretlab Titan Evo</a> emblazened
				with the Batman logo with <a href="https://amzn.to/3Td6ZXE" target="_blank">clear roller blade wheels</a> that are super smooth, even on carpet.
			</li>
			<li>
				I'm currently using a 2021 16" Macbook Pro M1 Max with 64 GB ram and a 2TB SSH. And of course, it's covered in stickers!
			</li>
			<li>
				My external monitors are 2x <a href="https://amzn.to/4hlijed" target="_blank">Phillips 4K UHD Monitors</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				One of the best investments I ever made was splurging on a <a href="https://www.zsa.io/moonlander" target="_blank">Moonlander Mark I keyboard</a>. It's a bit
				pricey, but has easily been the most comfortable and customizable keyboard I've ever used.
			</li>
			<li>
				After a recommendation from one of my fav podcasters, I upgraded my mouse to a <a href="https://amzn.to/3WnXqXL" target="_blank">Logitech MX Master 3S</a> and
				have been loving it!
			</li>
			<li>
				I recently upgraded my microphone to a <a href="https://amzn.to/4hlijed" target="_blank">Shure MV6</a> with a
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4alGiYk" target="_blank">Pneumatic Neewer Low Profile Mic Arm</a> and have been really happy with it.
			</li>
			<li>
				I use a <a href="https://amzn.to/3UFtsgU" target="_blank">Logitech for Creators StreamCam Premium Webcam</a> for video calls and recording videos.
			</li>
			<li>
				To light my office, I use 2 <a href="https://amzn.to/3ABCRPL" target="_blank">Neewer LED Panel Lights</a> that I bounce off the walls.
			</li>
			<li>
				With all these devices, I needed something to keep them all connected without having to deal with a bunch of cables...not to mention there are only
				so many ports on a Macbook. So I picked up a
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4cRDcen" target="_blank">StarTech.com Thunderbolt 3 to Dual DisplayPort Adapter</a>,
				a <a href="https://amzn.to/3XauWjH" target="_blank">Selore&S-Global USB C to Dual HDMI Adapter</a>, and a
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4g1zBgF" target="_blank">13 port LATORICE Powered USB Hub</a>
				to plug them all into. Then those are all connected via an
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4cQfrTK" target="_blank">OWC 5 Port Thunderbolt Hub</a>.
				Now when I get to my desk, all I have to do is plug in 1 USB C cable and everything is good to go!
			</li>
			<li>
				I've always hated having to carry around all kinds of bricks and adapters to plug in and charge stuff. I searched for a while
				and nothing really worked great, but finally I found this
				<a href="https://amzn.to/3Zaw8WS" target="_blank">Portable 7 Port Fast Charging Station</a>.
				Now I can charge my laptop, phone, iPad, and anything else I need all at the same time.
			</li>
			<li>
				I also tried a bunch of different USB C cables, but my favorite one by far has to be the
				<a href="https://amzn.to/4cK6P1b" target="_blank">Dbilida 6.6ft Thunderbolt 3 Cable (40Gbps)</a>. I've
				had it for a long time and it's still doing great!
			</li>
			<li>
				I carry everything in a <a href="https://amzn.to/3Xc3JwY" target="_blank">REEBOW GEAR Military Tactical Backpack Large Army 3 Day
				Assault Pack Molle Bag Backpack</a> The Molle system is fantastic when you have lots of gadgets and things you need to keep organized.
			</li>
			<li>
				I listen to <a href="https://amzn.to/3yYjMXj" target="_blank">Beats Fit Pro</a> earbuds most of the time, whether I'm at my desk or
				out and about.
			</li>
			<li>
				But when I don't have my earbuds in, I have a <a href="https://amzn.to/3AGTlWs" target="_blank">Creative Pebble Plus 2.1
				USB-Powered Desktop Speakers with Powerful Down-Firing Subwoofer</a> plugged in to my laptop for when I want to jam out.
			</li>
			<li>
				Another small but awesome little piece of gear is the <a href="https://amzn.to/3Tel2wb" target="_blank">Luxtude electronic organizer case</a>.
				This thing is fantastic for storing and organizing all my cables and accessories.
			</li>
			<li>
				After a long search for the right power bank to carry with me, I finally found the
				<a href="https://amzn.to/3AIFCym" target="_blank">Omni 20+ 20000mah Laptop Power Bank Portable Charger</a>. It's been the
				perfect companion for my laptop and phone when I'm on the go.

		<h2>Software</h2>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Recently I start testing out <a href="https://www.cursor.com/" target="_blank">Cursor</a> as my primary editor with the
				<a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.github-vscode-theme" target="_blank">GitHub Dark Default</a> theme.
				So far the experience has been great, but once GitHub Copilot and VSCode start offering similar features, I will likely switch back.
				<br>
				<br>
				But I was a longtime Vim user too, so I still open that up from time to time to edit files and make quick changes. I have a custom theme called
				<a href="https://github.com/iamthe-Wraith/breeze" target="_blank">Breeze</a> I use for Vim that's a fork of the
				<a href="https://github.com/dracula/vim" target="_blank">Dracula</a> theme.
			</li>
			<li>
				Not too long ago I switched to using the <a href="https://www.warp.dev/" target="_blank">Warp</a> terminal and have never looked back.
				It's a fantastic tool with so many little benefits I could (and do) go on about it for a while...but don't worry, I won't do that to you.
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="https://arc.net/" target="_blank">Arc</a> is my primary browser of choice, which I use for just about everything...but the company
				is no longer actively developing it, so I'm in the market for a new browser.
			</li>
			<li>
				I replaced Mac's built in Spotlight with <a href="https://www.raycast.com/" target="_blank">Raycast</a> (Pro version) for quick and easy access to
				multiple AI models and a bunch of plugins.
			</li>
			<li>
				For note taking I use <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank">Obsidian</a> with a few different vaults to help keep things organized. Particularly
				my "second brain", which is where I keep all my notes and ideas...a method I learned from one of my favorite books,
				<a href="https://amzn.to/3ZbBhOr" target="_blank">How to Take Smart Notes</a>.
			</li>
			<li>
				I've been using <a href="https://1password.com/" target="_blank">1Password</a> as my password manager for years now. It used to be LastPass, but I switched
				a few years ago after some security concerns.
			</li>
			<li>
				I've been a loyal <a href="https://proton.me/mail" target="_blank">Proton</a> customer for many years now. I use it for all my personal email,
				encrypted cloud storage, and VPN.
			</li>
			<li>
				I built <a href="https://buzybee.buzz" target="_blank">BuzyBee</a> to help myself manage all my tasks and projects using the
				<a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/" target="_blank">GTD Methodology</a>, and use it every day.
			</li>
			<li>
				I also recently switched to <a href="https://omnivore.app" target="_blank">Omnivore</a> to manage, organize and track all my reading. I was using
				<a href="https://readwise.io/" target="_blank">Readwise</a>, but wasn't really happy with it. Omnivore has been a great replacement.
